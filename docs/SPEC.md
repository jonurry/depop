## Background

At Depop one of the tasks a front end developer is often faced with is to bring a design to life and to communicate with an API in order to surface the information used in the design.

With this exercise we are interested in seeing how you approach this task.

A few notes before you start:

- Don't go crazy! Your free time is important to us.
- Don't worry if you don't have the time to finish the entire exercise or you get stuck.
- In a team communication is important and we like to share ideas, solutions and problems together!

## Exercise

This task is to create a basic shop page

A simple design can be found here for guidance: <https://drive.google.com/open?id=1XssSAHxZD2T66V0SxysKkkBSVqbGW5QX>

The API for the product data is available at: <https://5c78274f6810ec00148d0ff1.mockapi.io/api/v1/products>

### Requirements

- Retrieve data from the given API endpoint;
- Display the list of products;
- Add functionality to like/unlike a product;
- Add functionality to show/hide sold items;

### Tips

- Consider what makes a good application that will go into production
- You can use any library you want. (A good starting point to setup a modern web app is with "Create React App")
- A tested component is a reliable component!
- A readme detailing how to run the project and any notes you'd like to leave is always appreciated

### Submission

Push your exercise in a repository and send us the link. Alternatively, you can also email the zipped files.

Good luck and enjoy!
